    ### Prelude

    Haskell’s slogan of “avoid success at all costs” was a clever and cheeky way of saying that
    innovation and research in programming languages, especially in functional programming,
    needed some insulation to succeed. Ideas that were not perfectly understood needed iteration
    to fully develop in the minds of language innovators and users. By avoiding the “success at all
    costs” mentality of other language communities, the Haskell community bought time and space
    to try ideas that were not perfectly understood at first. Since then, the Haskell language has
    sparked so many lasting innovations in language design that its impact is now beyond doubt.
    What is the reason for this outsized impact? Haskell and related languages re-opened the
    connection between mathematical thinking on the one hand and compilers and programming
    languages on the other. It showed that these two fields should never have drifted so far apart.
    By removing the ceiling on the ideas that are easier to express in Haskell, it attracted the
    brightest minds and still does. It became a lingua franca for a large swath of CS research. In
    education, Haskell helps CS students learn to think better. The quality of ideas represented in
    the Haskell ecosystem has attracted both small and large companies. In many ways, the story
    of Haskell is one of success. Perhaps it was unavoidable after all.

    As good as the core concepts of Haskell are, users adopting it are often exposed to some very
    rough edges. We think it is time for Haskell to have a much smoother on-ramp and more
    real-world use cases where it is the clear first choice. There are now countless stories of Haskell
    adoption in the industry, but not all are successful. A few companies have even switched away
    from Haskell, for reasons that include difficulties with the compiler, tooling and hiring. Once
    users can get past these obstacles, they can achieve amazing outcomes, but too often the path
    to get there is not clear.

    Haskell is an open-source community. Almost all its tooling and community is created and run
    by a strong community of bright volunteers. But these contributors all have other day jobs, so
    the Haskell ecosystem still lacks crucial social, technical and organizational “glue”.
    We believe that every single obstacle standing in the way of Haskell adoption can be overcome.
    All technical issues are tractable and require a modest investment of energy, commitment and
    financial resources to fix. Likewise the social/community issues: the Haskell community is
    packed with friendly, able and motivated contributors who share common values. We think that
    by focusing our attention on the critical story of adoption, Haskell can
    encourage yet more
    innovation in the future, while bringing the benefits of its core ideas to a much larger user base.
    We need to encourage adoption in new ways and renew focus on improving the Haskell
    ecosystem.

    ### The Haskell Foundation

    That’s why we are forming a non-profit organization, provisionally called “The Haskell
    Foundation” (HF), dedicated to advancing the Haskell programming language, related tools,
    education and research.

    #### Goals

    HF has these goals:
    - To foster a much broader understanding of the benefits of using Haskell among developers who do not currently use Haskell.
    - To increase adoption of Haskell substantially, by erasing barriers that inhibit adoption.
    - To identify and fill missing “technical gaps”: the useful stuff that makes for a smooth user experience (pain-free installers, documentation, error messages, and much more).
    - To help with “community glue”, by nurturing respectful, inclusive communication across the community.
    Together these goals form the mission of HF.

    #### Principles and Ethos

    How ​ we pursue the goals of HF is just as important as ​ what t ​ he goals are. HF’s actions will be guided by these core principles:

    - **Open source**. Haskell is an open source community and HF will embrace the open-source ethos wholeheartedly. HF may develop, or sponsor the development of tools and infrastructure, but it will all be open source.
    - **Empowering the community**. A major goal of HF is to augment, celebrate, and coordinate the contributions and leadership of volunteers, not to supplant or replace them.
    - **Open, friendly, and diverse**. For many of us Haskell is more a way of life than a programming language. All are welcome, all can contribute.
    - **Transparent**. ​ All communication related to code and decision making will be publicly accessible, to enable asynchronous communication and collaboration. Only certain categories of sensitive information (e.g. financial, and matters concerning particular individuals) will be kept confidential.
    - **True to Haskell’s principles**.​ Haskell’s design puts principle ahead of expediency, notably by cleaving closely to the principles of purely functional programming. Success, yes, but not at all costs!

    We have learned from other open source communities. The ​Rust community​ has a code of
    conduct that has benefited the community. They do a remarkably good job of this, in large part
    because the Rust community is actively led and nurtured. ​ The Apache Software Foundation​ has
    developed clear standards of transparency and consistent governance across all of its 300+
    projects, run by volunteers. As we set up HF we have adopted successful approaches like these
    into our operating principles.

    #### Organization and Funding

    The organization will seek funding to ensure the longevity and continuous strengthening of the Haskell ecosystem.

    ##### Structure

    The Haskell community comprises an amazing group of technical talent and functions today as
    an almost entirely volunteer effort. Our goal is make every member of the Haskell community,
    and every HF-affiliated Haskell committee feel more support and more productive. We want to
    enlarge and diversify our community.

    We have received and incorporated lots of feedback about the best way to
    structure HF.
    - HF will have a ​ Governing Board​ (“Board” hereafter) that reflects the Haskell community and its stakeholders, including academics, commercial users, and individuals.
    - HF will have a staff. The size of the staff will depend on funding, but we intend to hire an Executive​ Director​ (ED), who can organize Haskell outreach, support its funding activities and oversee the rest of the staff. The staff will mostly focus on funding, marketing, and key infrastructure.
    - HF will work with existing and new open source teams to channel energy into various efforts like packaging, tools, libraries, compilers, languages, documentation, user experience, and infrastructure. To reiterate, we expect that most technical contributions will be volunteer, just as it is today, but we want to position HF to fill gaps that can help adoption.
    - HF will establish a code of conduct and transparent decision-making that will apply to itself and any associated teams.
    - To the extent HF funds and pursues technical goals itself, it will pursue those goals with the same transparency as we expect from any of the teams associated with it. In this way HF will augment the community in a transparent way.

    We think that HF represents one of the final puzzle pieces for Haskell. A new organization will
    provide a way to fund and coordinate Haskell development going forward. We hope that all key
    committees that currently support Haskell will align HF’s values and mission and we are working
    with those committees that wish to voluntarily affiliate with HF. Discussions with those teams are
    currently underway. We don’t want to simply add another Haskell committee.

    ##### Who are the HF organizers?
    The idea of the Haskell Foundation has been developed by an informal working group including
    - Representatives from the haskell.org committee, the Core Library Committee (CLC), the Hackage Trustees and the GHC Devops Committee, and other Haskellers.
    - Haskell companies, who are generously providing financial, advisory, and in-kind support.
    - Numerous long-standing members of the Haskell community.

    ##### Funding
    There have been other initiatives of this kind in the past, but they have proved hard to sustain.
    A big part of this has been a simple lack of bandwidth in a highly decentralised community run
    entirely by volunteers.
    We expect to launch with a small group of founding sponsors. The Board and staff will take over
    that function after launch. Our goal is to raise around $1m/year in cash and in-kind
    contributions.

    ### Improving the Haskell Adoption Story

    Promoting Haskell adoption has three major components:
    - Eliminating unreasonable and perceived barriers to adoption.
    - Educating the tech community about the benefits of adoption, including decision makers.
    - Enhancing the tooling, so that the risk of adoption is dramatically reduced.

    #### Eliminating unreasonable and perceived barriers to adoption

    We expect that with HF adding a little structure, some things can be improved immediately. For
    example, we need an entry point for Haskell that speaks to the needs of a range of users: from
    engineers looking for an easy on-ramp with our best advice on how to learn and use Haskell, to
    team leaders who want to assess Haskell adoption as a business decision. The Haskell
    community today does not cover the full range of content needed to promote adoption. This is
    one example where an organization with the right focus and some resources can easily have a
    positive impact.

    #### Educating the tech community

    Engineers are typically the ones who drive Haskell adoption. But they often need permission or
    sponsorship from managers 1 or 2 levels higher. These decision makers are people who are
    more concerned about speed of development, reliability, maintenance, and
    people. We need to
    explicitly address a broader audience and position Haskell as the best solution to many
    problems, while maintaining integrity and avoiding too much “marketing speak".

    Conditions for telling this story are favorable. The days of a senior sysadmin dictating which
    version of Java or Python “shall be used” are dying. Containers and cloud technology have
    inadvertently conspired to permit engineering teams to make these decisions more often at a
    team level, even in larger organizations. Still, these teams need air cover and solid tools so that
    their decisions don’t look “rogue” to the rest of the organization.

    If used correctly, Haskell can be unreasonably effective. Unfortunately, the “if” clause is not
    common knowledge. The HF recognizes that many of these advanced features are precisely the
    reason why Haskell can be successful in cases where other languages fall short. We trust that
    the end users will be able to make the right trade-offs that work for them. The HF will be there to
    help users that need to make these trade-offs by improving documentation and highlighting
    success stories. For example, Haskell has a great concurrency story and things like STM that
    are dramatically undersold in the marketplace. Some advanced features can be emphasized
    and taught.

    The spectrum of developers is very broad: Haskell is used by both junior developers as well as
    long-time experts. This can cause friction, and some code may be unreadable even to other
    Haskell developers. This is unfortunate, because we believe that Haskell allows us to express
    ideas in a way that are clear and elegant. We need to delineate the common knowledge aspect
    of the language and tools to elevate more developers. HF should carry this banner.

    Beyond that, the pesky problem of the marketplace for Haskellers remains. We often hear about
    fear of hiring bottlenecks and we know some engineering leaders that list this as the number
    one concern about Haskell. These leaders need to know one thing. You don’t have to hire a
    Haskell team: Haskell can make your team. Your smart Python developers can learn how to
    make reliable software and will love you for letting them. There is a role for HF to bridge the gap
    between the countless developers who want to learn and write Haskell, and the decision makers
    who currently believe it is hard to find these people.

    #### Technical Agenda: Enhancing the tooling, filling the gaps

    Haskell Foundation will identify a list of technical goals that will ease adoption and improve
    Haskell use in production. We have established an initial agenda and are seeking to refine it as
    we go forward. As HF evolves, we will engage technical discussion in a transparent way, with
    input from the community.
