    ### Guidelines For Respectful Communication
    The [guidelines for respectful communication](/guidelines-for-respectful-communication) guide how the we aim to comport ourselves and act with respect in the community. We do not seek to impose these guidelines on members of the Haskell community generally. Rather it is a signal that we seek high standards of discourse in the Haskell community, and are willing to publicly hold ourselves to that standard, in the hope that others may voluntarily follow suit.

    ### Whitepaper
    The Haskell Foundation began with a conversation about the goals and and context for HF that changed as the conversation grew ever wider. As we resolved to launch HF [this whitepaper](/whitepaper) is a snapshot of that conversation.

    ### Governance
    [This page](/governance) provides an overview of how we expect the Board to operate and its near term work and agenda.

    ### More on Affiliation
    Prospective affiliates can find more information on what affiliating with the Haskell Foundation entails [here](/affiliates).
