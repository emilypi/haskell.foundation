    ### Haskell Foundation Technical Agenda
    The [technical agenda](/technical-agenda) includes a list of projects that we expect the HF to cultivate and support, depending on resources. This list is meant to be suggestive, not definitive: as the HF continues to mature, we may find that other technical projects become more important than what is listed below. In particular, we expect the HF to support a function where we can collect feedback (encompassing instruments like surveys, interviews, and user studies), and then we hope to use that feedback to inform our technical priorities.

    ### Guidelines For Respectful Communication
    The [guidelines for respectful communication](/guidelines-for-respectful-communication) guide how the we aim to comport ourselves and act with respect in the community. We do not seek to impose these guidelines on members of the Haskell community generally. Rather it is a signal that we seek high standards of discourse in the Haskell community, and are willing to publicly hold ourselves to that standard, in the hope that others may voluntarily follow suit.

   ### Whitepaper
   The Haskell Foundation began with a conversation about the goals and and context for HF that changed as the conversation grew ever wider. As we resolved to launch HF [this whitepaper](./Haskell_Foundation_Whitepaper.pdf) is a snapshot of that conversation. 
   
   ### Governance
   [This paper](./Haskell_Foundation_Governance.pdf) provides an overview of how we expect the Board to operate and its near term work and agenda.
