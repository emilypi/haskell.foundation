    ### Haskell Foundation Technical Agenda
    The [technical agenda](/technical-agenda) includes a list of projects that we expect the HF to cultivate and support, depending on resources. This list is meant to be suggestive, not definitive: as the HF continues to mature, we may find that other technical projects become more important than what is listed below. In particular, we expect the HF to support a function where we can collect feedback (encompassing instruments like surveys, interviews, and user studies), and then we hope to use that feedback to inform our technical priorities.
