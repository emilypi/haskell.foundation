    #### Job Description

    #### Overview
    The Haskell Foundation (HF) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to driving Haskell adoption and open-source development. HF seeks to foster an understanding of the benefits of using Haskell among developers who do not currently use the language. The foundation will erase barriers to entry and improve the Haskell ecosystem, measuring its success by the increase in Haskell adoption. HF affiliates with and supports high-quality open source projects that nurture respectful communication and an inclusive community. More information about HF can be found on the web at haskell.foundation.

    #### The Opportunity
    HF seeks a full-time Executive Director (ED) to lead and develop the organization going forward. The ED is responsible for furthering the HF’s mission and vision, ensuring that resources are in place to accomplish its goals. The ED will lead sourcing for sponsorships, structure the organization, recruit and channel the efforts of volunteers. Over time the ED will recruit and retain paid staff who will help HF expand the set of activities the organization can pursue.
    Working with the Board, the ED will articulate the HF’s strategic priorities and direction. He or she will assess and evaluate strategies, decide how the organization will differentiate itself from other like-minded organizations in the region, and will hire teams, set budgets, forge alliances and build partnerships to further the mission.
    The ED will play a formative role in building the culture of HF around community service.   The HF will succeed if and only if it succeeds in unlocking the expertise and enthusiasm of volunteer members of the community.   This will be a major goal for the ED, so that volunteers find HF to be a solid professional home with ample opportunities for recognition and professional growth.
    The ED will invest heavily in the training, mentoring and capacity building at HF.
