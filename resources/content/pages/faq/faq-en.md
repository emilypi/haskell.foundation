    The [Haskell Foundation Technical Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVth1orvC6_hPp7YX0zYR8iTzCDBtM4esHOdfIxqmrk) outlines the current technical work that the Haskell Foundation is prioritizing.

    The Haskell.org committee has voted to affiliate with the Haskell Foundation; however, the haskell.org committee remains an independent 501-3 (c) nonprofit organization. The haskell.org committee will continue to operate the haskell.org website and provide resources for haskell infrastructure such as Hackage and the haskell mailing lists.

    The Haskell Foundation was founded by members of the Haskell community, with help and input from existing Haskell users, committees, and industrial users. Our sponsors page includes information about the organizations who have generously provided support for the Haskell Foundation.

    ### What is the relationship between HF and the community, industry, etc.

    The Haskell Foundation is an independent organization that was created to increase Haskell adoption across industry, the open source community, and academia. Many companies who see the value in Haskell have provided generous support to the Haskell Foundation. The Haskell Foundation was conceived of and created by long-time members of the Haskell community.
