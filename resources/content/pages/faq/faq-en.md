    ### How do projects or teams affiliate with the Haskell Foundation?

     Organizations and committees can review the [Haskell Foundation Affiliation Documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sL0Nw3VEvxLT39WOkKhtR2_sOUctwVSZ_A4GDZV_mvU/edit) to learn more about how you can become affiliated with the Haskell Foundation. Please email [contact@haskell.foundation](mailto:contact@haskell.foundation) for more information. 

    ### What technical agenda will HF pursue?

    The [Haskell Foundation Technical Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVth1orvC6_hPp7YX0zYR8iTzCDBtM4esHOdfIxqmrk) outlines the current technical work that the Haskell Foundation is prioritizing. The Haskell Foundation (HF) grants a new opportunity to invest in Haskell and increase its productivity. This technical agenda includes a list of projects that we expect the HF to cultivate and support, depending on resources. This list is meant to be suggestive, not definitive: as the HF continues to mature, we may find that other technical projects become more important than what is listed below. In particular, we expect the HF to support a function where we can collect feedback (encompassing instruments like surveys, interviews, and user studies), and then we hope to use that feedback to inform our technical priorities.

    ### What is the relationship between HF and haskell.org?

    The Haskell.org committee has voted to affiliate with the Haskell Foundation, however the haskell.org committee remains an independent 501-3 (c) nonprofit organization. The haskell.org committee will continue to operate the haskell.org website and provide resources for Haskell infrastructure such as Hackage and the haskell mailing lists. Several members of haskell.org have helped launch HF.

    ### Whoâ€™s involved?

    The Haskell Foundation was founded by members of the Haskell community, with help and input from existing Haskell users, committees, and industrial users. Our sponsors page includes information about the organizations who have generously provided support for the Haskell Foundation.

    ### What is the relationship between HF and the community, industry, etc.

    The Haskell Foundation is an independent organization that was created to increase Haskell adoption across industry, the open source community, and academia. Many companies who see the value in haskell have provided generous support to the haskell foundation. The Haskell Foundation was conceived of and created by long-time members of the Haskell community.
