    Haskell is not “just another programming language”: it embodies a radical and elegant attack on the entire enterprise of writing software. It profoundly influences the world of software for the better. The Haskell Foundation (HF) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to broadening the adoption of Haskell, by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research.
