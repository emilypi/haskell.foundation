    Haskell is not “just another programming language”: it embodies a radical and elegant attack on the entire enterprise of writing software. 
    
    Purely functional programming is based on values rather than state, and is rigorously explicit about side effects (the source of so many bugs in production). 
    
    Haskell is profoundly influencing the world of software for the better.

    The Haskell Foundation seeks to articulate the benefits of functional programming to a much broader audience, to erase barriers to entry, and to make Haskell into a solidly reliable basis for mission critical applications.

          **Faithfulness to Haskell’s founding design principles.** Haskell’s design puts principle ahead of expediency by cleaving closely to the principles of purely functional programming.

    Haskell’s slogan of “avoid success at all costs” was a clever and cheeky way of saying that innovation and research in programming languages, especially in functional programming, needed some insulation to succeed. Ideas that were not perfectly understood needed iteration to fully develop in the minds of language innovators and users. By avoiding the “success at all costs” mentality of other language communities, the Haskell community bought time and space to try ideas that were not perfectly understood at first. Since then, the Haskell language has sparked so many lasting innovations in language design that its impact is now beyond doubt. 

    What is the reason for this outsized impact? Haskell and related languages re-opened the connection between mathematical thinking on the one hand and compilers and programming languages on the other. It showed that these two fields should never have drifted so far apart. By removing the ceiling on the ideas that are easier to express in Haskell, it attracted the brightest minds and still does. It became a lingua franca for a large swath of CS research. In education, Haskell helps CS students learn to think better. The quality of ideas represented in the Haskell ecosystem has attracted both small and large companies. In many ways, the story of Haskell is one of success. Perhaps it was unavoidable after all.
