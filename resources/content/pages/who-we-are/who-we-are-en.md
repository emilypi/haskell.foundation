    ### Affiliated Committees and Projects

    We invite existing Haskell projects, committees and communities to
    explicitly affiliate and align themselves with the Haskell Foundation.
    Affiliation means that the group supports the goals of the Haskell
    Foundation, and that the Haskell Foundation in turn supports this group.
    We require affiliated groups to adhere to guidelines around transparency,
    being open to new members, and follow the
    [Haskell committee guidelines for respectful communication](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/GRC.rst).
    We believe that this will help us grow towards being a more open and
    welcoming community.

    The following groups affiliated with the Haskell Foundation:

     -  The [Haskell IDE Team](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
     -  The [GHC Steering Committee](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals)
     -  [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news/)

    The following groups are in the process of affiliating.  This means they
    endorse the Haskell Foundation but are still in the process of adopting the
    new guidelines:

     -  The [Core Libraries Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Core_Libraries_Committee)
     -  The [Haskell.org Committee](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-org-committee)
     -  The Haskell Admins
     -  [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

    This is not a closed list!  We very much want the Haskell Foundation to be
    something by _all of us_.  Please [contact](/en/contact/) us if you are
    interested in joining us in our quest to make Haskell better for everyone.
