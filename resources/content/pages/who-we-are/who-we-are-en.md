    ### Haskell Foundation Executive Director

    The Board of Directors is currently seeking an Executive Directory. The
    Haskell Foundation's executive director will oversee the daily operations
    of the foundation.

    ### The Haskell Foundation Interim Board of Directors

    The Haskell Foundation board of directors is a group of individuals who are
    responsible for managing and setting the direction of the Haskell
    Foundation. The [board of directors](/board-of-directors) are responsible
    for managing. The *interim board* will serve the Haskell Foundation
    during it's initial launch phase and will manage the establishment of the
    first full board.

      I’m a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England. I
      started here in Sept 1998. I’m also an Honorary Professor of the
      Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where I was a
      professor during 1990-1998.
      I am married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England. We
      have six children.
      I’m interested in the design, implementation, and application of
      lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means I spend
      a most of my time on the design and implementation of the
      language Haskell. In particular, much of my work is focused
      around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.
      I am chair of Computing at School, the group at the epicentre of
      the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England.
      Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths
      and natural science, that every child learns from primary school
      onwards (background here).

      Chris has been interested in Haskell since the early reports and
      wrote the original Alex package in the 1990s. In the late
      nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and
      in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the
      ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for
      IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new
      IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell
      in the back end.

      I’m a Professor of Software Technology in the Department of
      Information and Computing Sciences. My research focuses on how
      programming languages can be used to improve the quality of
      software. Conventional software testing is very important, but
      can’t guarantee the absence of errors. We are addressing this
      problem in our research on developing and using programming
      languages that are based on mathematical theory, so we can prove
      that a program will work in all scenarios. We call it
      ‘correctness by construction’. The real world significance is
      obvious: it saves a lot of time and it eliminates errors so which
      company wouldn’t want it?

      I spent most of my adult life trying to build reusable code in
      imperative languages before realizing I was building castles in
      sand. I converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better
      building materials. I now chair the Haskell core libraries
      committee, collaborate with hundreds of other developers on over
      200 projects on github, and I am obsessed with finding better
      tools so that seven years from now I won’t be stuck solving the
      same problems with small variations on the same tools I was stuck
      using seven years ago.

      Weirich graduated magna cum laude in 1996 from Rice University,
      with a bachelor's degree in computer science. At Rice, she
      became interested in programming languages through an
      undergraduate research project with Matthias Felleisen. She
      moved to Cornell University for her graduate studies, completing
      her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation, Programming with Types,
      was supervised by Greg Morrisett. She joined the University of
      Pennsylvania faculty in 2002.

    The following groups affiliated with the Haskell Foundation:

     -  The [Haskell IDE Team](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
     -  The [GHC Steering Committee](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals)
     -  [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news/)

    The following groups are in the process of affiliating.  This means they
    endorse the Haskell Foundation but are still in the process of adopting the
    new guidelines:

     -  The [Core Libraries Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Core_Libraries_Committee)
     -  The [Haskell.org Committee](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-org-committee)
     -  The Haskell Admins
     -  [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

    This is not a closed list!  We very much want the Haskell Foundation to be
    something by _all of us_.  Please [contact](/en/contact/) us if you are
    interested in joining us in our quest to make Haskell better for everyone.

    #### The Hackage Trustees

    Placeholder text until the Hackage Trustees provide an official statement.

    #### Volunteers

    This is a placeholder for space we will use to include key volunteers who are not on the board or with one of the affiliated committees.
