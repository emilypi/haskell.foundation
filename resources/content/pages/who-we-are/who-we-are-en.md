    ### Haskell Foundation Executive Director

    The Board of Directors is currently seeking an Executive Directory. The
    Haskell Foundation's executive director will oversee the daily operations
    of the foundation.

    ### The Haskell Foundation Interim Board of Directors

    The Haskell Foundation board of directors is a group of individuals who are
    responsible for managing and setting the direction of the Haskell
    Foundation. The [board of directors](/board-of-directors) are responsible
    for managing. The *interim board* will serve the Haskell Foundation
    during it's initial launch phase and will manage the establishment of the
    first full board.

    #### Members of the Interim Board of Directors

    |**Simon Peyton Jones**|
    |I’m a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England. I   |
    |started here in Sept 1998. I’m also an Honorary Professor of the  |
    |Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where I was a |
    |professor during 1990-1998.                                       |
    |                                                                  |
    |I am married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England. We    |
    |have six children.                                                |
    |                                                                  |
    |I’m interested in the design, implementation, and application of  |
    |lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means I spend |
    |a most of my time on the design and implementation of the         |
    |language Haskell. In particular, much of my work is focused       |
    |around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.       |
    |                                                                  |
    |I am chair of Computing at School, the group at the epicentre of  |
    |the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England.   |
    |Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths   |
    |and natural science, that every child learns from primary school  |
    |onwards (background here).                                        |

    |**Chris Dornan**|
    |Chris has been interested in Haskell since the early reports and  |
    |wrote the original Alex package in the 1990s. In the late         |
    |nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and |
    |in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the |
    |ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for  |
    |IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new     |
    |IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell  |
    |in the back end.                                                  |

    |**Gabriele Keller**|
    |I’m a Professor of Software Technology in the Department of       |
    |Information and Computing Sciences. My research focuses on how    |
    |programming languages can be used to improve the quality of       |
    |software. Conventional software testing is very important, but    |
    |can’t guarantee the absence of errors. We are addressing this     |
    |problem in our research on developing and using programming       |
    |languages that are based on mathematical theory, so we can prove  |
    |that a program will work in all scenarios. We call it             |
    |‘correctness by construction’. The real world significance is     |
    |obvious: it saves a lot of time and it eliminates errors so which |
    |company wouldn’t want it?                                         |

    |**Jasper Van er Jeugt**|
    |Jasper is a Principal Engineer at Fugue, a cloud security startup.|
    |He has been deeply involved in the Haskell community for over ten |
    |years, contributing as open source maintainer as well as community|
    |organizer, with efforts like ZuriHac and Summer of Haskell.  He   |
    |currently chairs the Haskell.org committee.                       |

    |**Edward Kmett**|
    |I spent most of my adult life trying to build reusable code in    |
    |imperative languages before realizing I was building castles in   |
    |sand. I converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better   |
    |building materials. I now chair the Haskell core libraries        |
    |committee, collaborate with hundreds of other developers on over  |
    |200 projects on github, and I am obsessed with finding better     |
    |tools so that seven years from now I won’t be stuck solving the   |
    |same problems with small variations on the same tools I was stuck |
    |using seven years ago.                                            |

    |**Stephanie Weirich**|
    |Stephanie Weirich is an American computer scientist specializing  |
    |in type theory, type inference, dependent types, and functional   |
    |programming. She is a professor of computer science at the        |
    |University of Pennsylvania.                                       |
    |                                                                  |
    |Weirich graduated magna cum laude in 1996 from Rice University,   |
    |with a bachelor's degree in computer science. At Rice, she        |
    |became interested in programming languages through an             |
    |undergraduate research project with Matthias Felleisen. She       |
    |moved to Cornell University for her graduate studies, completing  |
    |her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation, Programming with Types,      |
    |was supervised by Greg Morrisett. She joined the University of    |
    |Pennsylvania faculty in 2002.                                     |
