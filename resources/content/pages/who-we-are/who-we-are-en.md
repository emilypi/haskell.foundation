    ### The Haskell Foundation Interim Board of Directors

    The Haskell Foundation [board of directors](/board-of-directors) are
    responsible for managing and setting the direction of the Haskell
    Foundation. HF's current board will serve on an interim basis during the launch phase and will manage the establishment of the
    first full board in early 2021.
  team:
  - name: Simon Peyton Jones
    location: Chair

    description: |
      Simon is a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.
      He started there in Sept 1998. He’s also an Honorary Professor of
      the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where he
      was a professor during 1990-1998.

      Simon is married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England.
      They have six children.

      Simon is interested in the design, implementation, and application
      of lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means he
      spends a most of my time on the design and implementation of the
      language Haskell. In particular, much of his work is focused
      around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.

      Simon is also chair of Computing at School, the group at the
      epicentre of the reform of the national curriculum for Computing
      in England. Computer science is now a foundational subject,
      alongside maths and natural science, that every child learns from
      primary school onwards.
    role:
  - name: Chris Dornan

      Chris has been interested in Haskell since the early reports and
      wrote the original Alex package in the 1990s. In the late
      nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and
      in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the
      ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for
      IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new
      IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell
      in the back end.
    role:
  - name: Gabriele Keller
    location:  Interim Board Member

      Gabriele is Professor of Software Technology in the Department of
      Information and Computing Sciences. Her research focuses on how
      programming languages can be used to improve the quality of
      software. Conventional software testing is very important, but
      can’t guarantee the absence of errors. She is addressing this
      problem in her research on developing and using programming
      languages that are based on mathematical theory, so we can prove
      that a program will work in all scenarios. Call it
      ‘correctness by construction’. The real world significance is
      obvious: it saves a lot of time and it eliminates errors, so which
      company wouldn’t want it?
    role:
  - name: Jasper Van der Jeugt
    location:  Interim Board Member

    description: |
      Jasper is a Principal Engineer at Fugue, a cloud security startup.
      He has been deeply involved in the Haskell community for over ten
      years, contributing as open source maintainer as well as community
      organizer, with efforts like ZuriHac and Summer of Haskell. He
      currently chairs the Haskell.org committee.
    role: ''
  - name: Edward Kmett
    location:  Interim Board Member
    avatar:  './images/ek.png'
    description: |
      Edward is a researcher focused on AI safety at the Machine
      Intelligence Research Institute. He also sits on the board of the
      Topos Institute, promoting category theory in industry as a tool for
      exchanging ideas. Outside of Haskell he's worked on graphics and
      special effects, telecommunications, finance, linguistics, and once
      helped Taiwan point a big RADAR at China.

      Edward found Haskell in 2006 and at the time mistakenly believed all
      Haskellers were thoroughly fluent in category theory, so he started
      blogging to this imaginary audience. A few years later his work on
      lenses provided a more practical impetus for more folks to learn some
      of these ideas, closing the circle. He currently maintains well over a
      hundred Haskell libraries covering a rather wide swathe of topics and
      isn't entirely sure how he backed himself in that position.
    role:
  - name: Stephanie Weirich
    location:  Interim Board Member

    description: |
      Stephanie Weirich is the ENIAC President's Distinguished Professor of
      Computer and Information Science at the University of
      Pennsylvania. Her research areas include functional programming, type
      systems, machine-assisted theorem proving and dependent types.  She
      and her students have made significant contributions to the design of
      the type system of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.  Dr. Weirich was
      recognized by the SIGPLAN Milner Young Researcher award (2016), a
      Microsoft Outstanding collaborator award, and a most influential ICFP
      paper award (awarded in 2016, for 2006). She has served as the general
      chair of ICFP 2020 and as the program chair of POPL 2018, ICFP 2010,
      and the 2009 Haskell Symposium.

      Simon Marlow is a Software Engineer at Facebook in London.  He has
      previously worked on Haxl, a Haskell-based domain-specific language
      that is used by the teams fighting abuse on Facebook, and he is
      currently working on Glean, a system to store and query facts about
      source code at scale. Simon is a co-author of the Glasgow Haskell
      Compiler, author of the book “Parallel and Concurrent Programming in
      Haskell”, and has a string of research publications in functional
      programming, language design, compilers, and language implementation.
