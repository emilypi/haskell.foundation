    ### Haskell Foundation Executive Director

    The Board of Directors is currently seeking an Executive Directory. The
    Haskell Foundation's executive director will oversee the daily operations
    of the foundation.

    ### The Haskell Foundation Interim Board of Directors

    The Haskell Foundation board of directors is a group of individuals who are
    responsible for managing and setting the direction of the Haskell
    Foundation. The [board of directors](/board-of-directors) are responsible
    for managing. The *interim board* will serve the Haskell Foundation
    during it's initial launch phase and will manage the establishment of the
    first full board.

    #### Members of the Interim Board of Directors

    |**Simon Peyton Jones**|
    |I’m a researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England. I   |
    |started here in Sept 1998. I’m also an Honorary Professor of the  |
    |Computing Science Department at Glasgow University, where I was a |
    |professor during 1990-1998.                                       |
    |                                                                  |
    |I am married to Dorothy, a priest in the Church of England. We    |
    |have six children.                                                |
    |                                                                  |
    |I’m interested in the design, implementation, and application of  |
    |lazy functional languages. In practical terms, that means I spend |
    |a most of my time on the design and implementation of the         |
    |language Haskell. In particular, much of my work is focused       |
    |around the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and its ramifications.       |
    |                                                                  |
    |I am chair of Computing at School, the group at the epicentre of  |
    |the reform of the national curriculum for Computing in England.   |
    |Computer science is now a foundational subject, alongside maths   |
    |and natural science, that every child learns from primary school  |
    |onwards (background here).                                        |

    |**Chris Dornan**|
    |Chris has been interested in Haskell since the early reports and  |
    |wrote the original Alex package in the 1990s. In the late         |
    |nineties Chris taught Haskell to undergraduates in UCC (Cork) and |
    |in the noughties used Haskell tools to develop key aspects of the |
    |ARMv7 architecture. Since 2013 Chris has been chief Engineer for  |
    |IRIS Connect where he has overseen the development of the new     |
    |IRIS Connect video platform which makes extensive use of Haskell  |
    |in the back end.                                                  |

    |**Jasper Van er Jeugt**|
    |Jasper is a Principal Engineer at Fugue, a cloud security startup.|
    |He has been deeply involved in the Haskell community for over ten |
    |years, contributing as open source maintainer as well as community|
    |organizer, with efforts like ZuriHac and Summer of Haskell.  He   |
    |currently chairs the Haskell.org committee.                       |

    |**Edward Kmett**|
    |I spent most of my adult life trying to build reusable code in    |
    |imperative languages before realizing I was building castles in   |
    |sand. I converted to Haskell in 2006 while searching for better   |
    |building materials. I now chair the Haskell core libraries        |
    |committee, collaborate with hundreds of other developers on over  |
    |200 projects on github, and I am obsessed with finding better     |
    |tools so that seven years from now I won’t be stuck solving the   |
    |same problems with small variations on the same tools I was stuck |
    |using seven years ago.                                            |

    | ![Stephanie Weirich](../../images/board-bio/sw.png) |

    |**Stephanie Weirich**|
    |Stephanie Weirich is an American computer scientist specializing  |
    |in type theory, type inference, dependent types, and functional   |
    |programming. She is a professor of computer science at the        |
    |University of Pennsylvania.                                       |
    |                                                                  |
    |Weirich graduated magna cum laude in 1996 from Rice University,   |
    |with a bachelor's degree in computer science. At Rice, she        |
    |became interested in programming languages through an             |
    |undergraduate research project with Matthias Felleisen. She       |
    |moved to Cornell University for her graduate studies, completing  |
    |her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation, Programming with Types,      |
    |was supervised by Greg Morrisett. She joined the University of    |
    |Pennsylvania faculty in 2002.                                     |

    |Simon Marlow is a British computer programmer, author, and        |
    |co-developer of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He and Simon  |
    |Peyton Jones won the SIGPLAN Programming Languages Software Award |
    |in 2011 for their work on GHC. Marlow's book Parallel and         |
    |Concurrent Programming in Haskell was published in August 2013.   |

    |Formerly of Microsoft Research, Marlow has worked at Facebook     |
    |since March 2013. The "noted Haskell guru" is part of the team    |
    |behind Facebook's open source Haxl project, a Haskell library     |
    |that simplifies access to remote data.                            |

    ### Affiliated Committees and Projects

    We invite existing Haskell projects, committees and communities to
    explicitly affiliate and align themselves with the Haskell Foundation.
    Affiliation means that the group supports the goals of the Haskell
    Foundation, and that the Haskell Foundation in turn supports this group.
    We require affiliated groups to adhere to guidelines around transparency,
    being open to new members, and follow the
    [Haskell committee guidelines for respectful communication](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/GRC.rst).
    We believe that this will help us grow towards being a more open and
    welcoming community.

    The following groups affiliated with the Haskell Foundation:

     -  The [Haskell IDE Team](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
     -  The [GHC Steering Committee](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals)
     -  [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news/)

    The following groups are in the process of affiliating.  This means they
    endorse the Haskell Foundation but are still in the process of adopting the
    new guidelines:

     -  The [Core Libraries Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Core_Libraries_Committee)
     -  The [Haskell.org Committee](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-org-committee)
     -  The Haskell Admins
     -  [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

    This is not a closed list!  We very much want the Haskell Foundation to be
    something by _all of us_.  Please [contact](/en/contact/) us if you are
    interested in joining us in our quest to make Haskell better for everyone.

    #### The Hackage Trustees

    Placeholder text until the Hackage Trustees provide an official statement.

    #### Volunteers

    This is a placeholder for space we will use to include key volunteers who are not on the board or with one of the affiliated committees.
